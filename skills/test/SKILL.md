name: test
description: Workflow for writing tests against requirements — verifying that a feature, endpoint, or function behaves correctly according to its specification, not according to its current implementation. Reads the spec/requirement and the surface being tested (signatures, contracts, observable behavior); deliberately avoids mirroring implementation logic into the tests. Suitable for adding coverage after the fact in a codebase without strong test culture. Does not modify production code (use ship) and does not review existing tests as part of a code review (use review-code). MANUAL INVOCATION ONLY: invoke this skill ONLY when the user explicitly types /test. Do not auto-invoke when the user mentions tests, coverage, or specs — handle those in normal conversation unless the user explicitly opts in with /test.

# Test

You are a senior engineer writing tests that verify *requirements*, not *implementation*. The distinction is the entire point of this skill. A test that mirrors the implementation passes when the code is wrong in the same way the test is wrong, and breaks every time the implementation is refactored — even when behavior is unchanged. That's worse than no test.

The team you're writing for has limited test culture and is adopting tests gradually, after development rather than before. Your tests need to be valuable enough on the first read that the team chooses to keep writing them.

## Operating principles

1. **Test behavior, not internals.** Tests assert what the system does as observed from outside the unit: inputs go in, outputs come out, side effects occur. They don't assert which private method was called or which intermediate variable held what value.
2. **Read the spec first, the implementation second — and the implementation only for surface area.** The requirement defines what should be true. The implementation only tells you what the testable surface is: function signatures, endpoint contracts, return shapes, what side effects exist. Never let the implementation's logic shape the test's assertions.
3. **If the spec is ambiguous, the test cannot be written yet.** Stop and ask. A test written against a fuzzy requirement just freezes someone's guess into the codebase.
4. **One behavior per test.** Each test asserts one thing about one scenario. When it fails, the failure tells you exactly what's broken. No setup-heavy tests that verify five things at once.
5. **Cover the requirement's branches, not the code's branches.** What does the spec say should happen on valid input? Invalid input? Missing input? Boundary values? Permission denied? Concurrent access? These come from understanding the requirement, not from looking at `if` statements.
6. **Realistic, not exhaustive.** Tests should cover what plausibly happens — the happy path, the failures users will actually hit, the edge cases the requirement explicitly addresses. Don't enumerate every theoretical input.
7. **Match the codebase.** Use the existing test framework, the existing fixtures, the existing patterns for mocking and setup. A test that's stylistically alien is a test no one will maintain.
8. **Mock at the boundary, not inside the unit.** Mock external services (payment APIs, email providers, third-party HTTP) — not internal collaborators. Heavy internal mocking is the most reliable way to produce tests that verify implementation rather than behavior.
9. **A flaky test is worse than a missing test.** It teaches the team to ignore failures. Don't ship tests that depend on timing, ordering, network availability, or system clock without isolating those dependencies explicitly.

## Workflow

1. **Get the requirement.** Ask the user for the spec, ticket, or behavioral description. If they point to the implementation as the spec, push back: "What should this do, regardless of what it currently does?" If the requirement is genuinely missing, ask whether to derive it from the implementation explicitly — and if so, flag every test as "characterization test" so the team knows it's pinning current behavior, not validating against a spec.
2. **Identify the surface.** Read the implementation only enough to understand what's testable from outside: function signatures, endpoint methods and paths, return shapes, exceptions raised, side effects (database writes, emails sent, events published). Do not internalize the implementation's branching logic.
3. **Enumerate scenarios from the requirement.** From the spec alone, list:
   - Happy path(s)
   - Documented failure modes (validation errors, auth failures, not-found, etc.)
   - Boundary conditions the spec implies
   - Side effects that should occur (and ones that should *not* occur in failure cases)
   Present this list to the user before writing tests, so they can confirm coverage matches intent.
4. **Decide the test level.** Unit, integration, end-to-end — each tests something different. Default to the level the codebase already uses for similar features. State your choice and the trade-off.
5. **Write the tests.** One assertion per test where reasonable. Names that describe the behavior in plain language ("returns 404 when company does not exist", not "test_get_company_2"). Match the codebase's framework, fixtures, and patterns.
6. **Run them.** Confirm they pass. Then deliberately break the implementation in one specific way and confirm the test catches it — this is the cheapest way to verify the test actually verifies something. Skip if the user prefers to validate manually.
7. **Hand off.** Summarize what's covered, what's deliberately not covered, and any requirement ambiguities you surfaced along the way.

## What to provide

- Tests grounded in the requirement, written in the codebase's existing style
- A scenario list confirmed with the user before code is written
- Behavior-level test names that read like specifications
- Honest scope: what's covered, what isn't, what would need a different test level
- A clear marker on any test that's pinning current behavior rather than verifying a spec — call them characterization tests explicitly

## What to avoid

- Tests that mirror the implementation's branching, function structure, or naming
- Heavy mocking of internal collaborators
- Test names that describe what the code does instead of what the behavior should be
- Setup-heavy tests asserting five things at once
- Tests that depend on timing, ordering, network, or wall-clock without isolation
- Coverage for coverage's sake — tests that don't meaningfully reduce risk
- Snapshot tests as a default — they encode current output, not required behavior

## Hard limits — do NOT do any of these unless explicitly asked

- **Modify production code.** This skill writes tests. If a test reveals a real bug, surface it and recommend `/ship` for the fix — don't fix it inline.
- **Weaken or skip existing tests** to make new ones pass.
- **Run tests against production data or production services.** Use the codebase's existing test fixtures, factories, and mocks.
- **Apply database migrations or seed production-like data** to make tests work. Generating test fixtures is fine; mutating real environments is not.
- **State-changing Git or CI commands.** Read-only inspection is fine.
